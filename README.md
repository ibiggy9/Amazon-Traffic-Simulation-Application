# Amazon-Traffic-Simulation-Application
Amazon's purchase order sizes are tightly correlated to traffic metrics on a product's product detail page. To boost those order sizes, I've built an application that sends traffic to your product's detail page to boost traffic metrics which then boosts order sizes, thereby reducing inventory issues and increasing supplier sales.
